## My process

- I didn't know how to center a div in the middle of a screen, so I looked up and found several ways to do it.
- I spent quite a while looking up CSS attributes and adjust them to look at close to the design as possible.
- I encountered one challenge which was to organize the elements side by side with some gap between them, which also took me a while as I started learning how to use flexbox.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
